 <h3>Project Idea.</h3>
 <p><B>Overview</B></p>
<h2>Topic</h2>

 <p>The project will be a health diagnoses application that will give health diagnoses and advice based on the user’s health data and described symptoms.  It will use an android application to provide a broad range of features that are usually separated into different applications. These services will involve health advice, health tracking, and discussion forums, which will provide benefits to the user and consulted medical professionals. Health advice will offer preventative and reactive medical advice which enables the user to improve health whilst preventing and treating illnesses.</p>
 <p>To provide the high-quality advice, artificial intelligence and cloud computing services will be used to store and analyse medical data which advises based on the latest medical standards. Additionally, forums will be used to discuss health, fitness, and general topics which will provide a social and engaging atmosphere. The application is intended as a tool to be used in conjunction with the appropriate healthcare professionals should be consulted about the information provided by the application.</p>

<h2>Project Idea.</h2>
<p><B>The importance of developing this project</B></p>
 <p>Health is a foundation for happiness and productivity, as well as a major economic concern, it shows a strong reason for developing tools that assist with the promotion of individual health. The health industry is growing every year, and with the increased growth and availability of information, it is becoming more difficult to make an optimal choice to improve and manage our health. This lack of certainty and increased complexity creates a need for the simplification and streamlining of medical information to the individual.</p>

 <p><B>How does it fit in with current IT trends?</B></p>
 <p>To alleviate the concerns with choosing from many health options, technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and health tracking devices are allowing for improvements in the provision of health-related services. Currently there are applications which provide symptom checking services by utilising artificial intelligence, however the scope of these could be expanded. Expanding the scope health applications to advise based on medical history and monitored health data, in addition to symptoms, will provide more accurate health advice resulting in better health outcomes.</p>

 <p><B>What would it show to a future employer if you were able to work on this project?</B></p>
 <p>Undertaking this project will show future employers that we can identify a need in the market and utilise current technology to provide a solution. The project requires extensive knowledge of software development concepts including artificial intelligence, android and iOS application development, and user-interface design. The technical skills required for this project will demonstrate an ability to work on projects with a similar level of required expertise.</p>
  <p>Although the technical skills an integral part of the project it is also our ability to plan and manage the development process that will display our project management skills. Individually, or in combination, the technical and project management skills will demonstrate a competency to take on similar projects and will be a great indicator of success to future employers.</p>

 <h2>Landscape </h2>
 <p><B>What similar systems or products are available? </B></p>
 <p>There are many health diagnoses applications and services available that will utilise artificial intelligence and a database of medical information to evaluate described symptoms by the user. This usually entails a step-by-step process of questions that eventuate in a health diagnosis. These applications advise that their provided health diagnoses are used as a guideline and that a medical professional should also be consulted. This application can benefit the medical professional and user by acting as a tool to be used in conjunction with other medical expertise.</p>

 <p><B>What competitors are there? </B></p>
 <p>An application most like our proposed project is the “Ada – Check your health” application available on iOS/android. Ada diagnoses medical conditions based on the information provided to it by the user through its symptom checking questions. The information entered by the user will be used by artificial intelligence and compared to their medical dictionary and database of medical conditions.</p>
 <p>Another example is “Symptomate” which is a preliminary health diagnoses tool available as a browser service and on iOS/android. It symptom checks based on information provided by the user and utilises artificial intelligence to compare their database of scientific literature, statistics, and information of previous patients to offer health advice. Symptomate is also advertised as a business solution to reduce triage times and prevent unnecessary visits to doctors.</p>]

<p><B>What points of difference are there about your project compared to what exist now?</B></p>
 <p>The difference between our health diagnoses application and applications such as Ada and Symptomate is that, in addition to symptom checking, our application also provides the following:</p>
  <p>*Provides a permanent health profile based on previous medical history and the user’s most up to date information </p>
   <p>*Utilises devices such as Smart fitness watches which record blood pressure, resting heart rate, and other data to provide a more accurate assessment of their current health condition.</p>
    <p>*Provide social environment through a discussion forum for users to discuss their health concerns.</p>


 <h3>Detailed description </h3>
  <h2>Aims</h2>
  <p>The aim of the application is to provide comprehensive and accurate health diagnoses by utilising current technologies, medical science information, and the recorded medical data of the user.</p>
  <p>The application will use a comprehensive combination of previously recorded medical information and up-to-date information. The previously recorded medical history, such as patient records, are manually entered into a user profile; the up-to-date information is obtained by utilising devices such as smart watches worn by users to track health data. It will then use this information to accurately diagnose health conditions by using artificial intelligence to compare the health data to a database of medical diagnostic related information. By having a user profile that has a comprehensive range of medical data recorded on it the application will be able to diagnose illnesses more accurately than previous applications that only asks for symptoms.</p>

<p><B>Goals</B></p>
 <p>The following goals are order in importance with 1 being the most important. This order is based what is required before the next goal can or should be achieved. The first goals of 1/2 are choosing the innovative features of the application before deciding how we will implement them in goal 3. Going forward we make progress in goal 4/5 by choosing a platform for the application and starting to build a prototype to display its features. Considering that each goal builds upon the foundation of the goal before it we believe it is most effective to start from goal 1 and progress forwards to goal 10.</p>

 <p><B>Goal 1: Choose the most important features(s) of the application.</B></p>
 <p>To differential our health diagnosis application from other applications we need to include a range of features to improve upon existing applications. We have decided that the most important part of the application is the ability to record and keep track of health conditions which will improve diagnosing accuracy. With the use of user health records and the symptom checking process it will provide a better outcome than previous iterations of symptom checkering applications which tends to ask only a few background questions without recording them for future use.</p>
  <p><B>Goal 2: Choose which devices should be used to track health data.</B></p>
 <p>The application intends to record health data in a combination of previous medical history and currently tracked health data. This brings up the question of how we will track health data with the application to provide the most accurate diagnoses based on the most up-to-date information. We need to decide if we should first focus on the health tracking capabilities of the various smart fitness watches currently available on the market, or if there are other more important devices to adapt to the application. Important health data tracked by fitness watches includes blood pressure, blood oxygen levels and resting heart rate. By starting with the incorporation of health data tracking capabilities of smart watches, the application will be able to provide easy to access current health data. </p>
   <p><B>Goal 3: Find the best way to analyse the health data to offer a diagnoses.</B></p>
 <p>To provide an accurate health diagnoses to the user by sorting through their health data and comparing it to the available medical science data is an exceptionally large task. To provide a diagnosis the application needs to compare the health data of the user to a library or database of medical literature and scientific information. Our solution to sort through and the ever-increasing medical science data available is to use artificial intelligence to analyse the information and offer health diagnoses.</p>

 <p>It is also important to figure out how to develop artificial intelligence and whether we should use existing developed artificial intelligence from providers such as Amazon web services. With the use of Artificial Intelligence, the process of recording data, analysing, and diagnosing will continue to improve itself with continued use of users, and comparatively to using humans for computing the artificial intelligence will be more efficient, faster, and available every hour of every week.  </p>

<p><B>Goal 4: Decide whether to use one, or a combination of Web browser, iOS, or android for the application.</B></p>
<p>The application will need to be built using a web browser, iOS, or android. Although having all three of these platforms would be the end goal, it will be more prudent to focus on one platform and then expand to the others after the project has been proven on one of the platforms. A web browser service would available across all three platforms compared to a specific iOS/android application, but we needed an application that could also interact with a range of other applications and devices connected to the mobile phone. With the requirement of interacting with devices such as smart fitness watches and we have decided to first build the application on android mobile to avoid the competition.</p>

<p><B>Goal 5: Develop the application.</B></p>
<p>The technology needed to create this application is complex and above our skill levels, however we can provide an interface that clearly displays the intended purpose of the application and what features it will have to offer for the users. With a visual example of the application, it will allow our team to make small iterative progress on the layout of the user interface. This will allow future people working on the project to build upon our progress and develop and complete the development of the application.</p>

<p><B>Goal 6: How will the application gather and store medical information for the application to reference.</B></p>
 <p>For the application to be effective, it will need to reference a large database of medical science and literature in addition to recording the user’s information. We have decided to use existing cloud service retailers such as google or AWS, but we need to decide which cloud computing service to use to handle all the storage, security and computing needs. Choosing the most suitable cloud service that provides all relevant services (such as AI and security) needs for our project will allow for efficiency in production going forward.</p>

 <p><B>Goal 7: What sources of medical information will be referenced to provide users with diagnoses.</B></p>
  <p>It is important for the application to draw upon the most credible and reliable sources of information for medical diagnoses of the user. Sources of information could include medical science literature, disease databases, and other user’s medical data. To enable an accurate diagnose we need to decide where the application will reference its information from.</p>

  <p><B>Goal 8: Find a method to secure the user’s health data information for privacy purposes.</B></p>
   <p>Ensuring the privacy of the user’s medical information is important for privacy reasons. No user would want their medical information to be exposed without consent and exploited. We find the best way to provide security to the users.</p>


   <p><B>Goal 9: Think of further devices to be used to track health data for the application.</B></p>
   <p>There are a range of additional health devices that can be used to track health data such as smart pills and safety belts. Smart pills track whether a user has ingested their medications and is useful for forgetfulness; safety belts expand and soften the fall of users who may have issues with balance such as the elderly. These are only two types of devices that can track health data for the application to provide the most up-to-date medical guidance and diagnoses. Going forward we will need to decide whether to include these devices or what other types of devices should be included in the applications health data tracking functionality.</p>

  <p><B>Goal 10: Obtain permission from My Health Record to interact with their health record service.</B></p>
 <p>My Health record is an online health record that is accessed through government websites. The service allows individual health information to be recorded and added to by healthcare professionals. This summary of information makes it easier for the user and healthcare professionals to provide accurate care by utilising the patient’s current health data. By having the medical history of the patient is one place it reduces the time spent gathering medical information.</p>

<p>Currently, My Health Record does not let applications store information about the user’s records and only allow a ‘read only’ version of data. If our application was to be granted access automatically record the health data, then it’d remove the tedium of the user manually entering their health records into our health diagnoses application.</p>

<p><B>Goal 11: Plan a marketing strategy to advertise the application.</B></p>
<p>There are vast amounts of health applications available, and it is important to set ourselves apart from competitors. We need to plan advertising features of our application whilst promoting the innovations it will bring to the market and conveniences the users will benefit form. Plans of utilising social media, GP clinics, and other traditional methods need to be considered. With proper marketing strategy the application will have the best chance of showcasing it’s benefits and staying relevant in the competitive market.</p>




 <h2>Plans and Progress </h2>
 <p><B>How it the project idea began </B></p>
<p>The idea of the application initially started as a health diagnoses application that was brainstormed by James in Assignment 1. The idea came from identifying innovations on health diagnoses applications that James had recently used. The health diagnosing application James used only asked for a few pieces of data, such as “does the user smoke or drink alcohol” before continuing to ask for symptoms and diagnose health conditions based on that information. It was James’s belief that this application was extremely useful but could be improved by expanding the available features which would include the following:</p>
  <p>*Using the user’s complete medical history to supplement the diagnoses.</p>
  <p>*Record the users’ data to avoid the time-consuming aspect of re-entering data in future uses of the application. </p>
  <p>*Utilising devices such as fitness watches, which can provide data such as blood pressure, to increase the accuracy of the diagnoses. </p>
  <p>*Provide a forum for users to talk about health interests or concerns.</p>
  <p>*Provide information on contraindicative interactions of medications. </p>

<p>The most important part of the application is diagnosing based on a complete medical history of the user. Usually, the process of diagnosing based on described symptoms alone is lengthy and requires entering a limited medical history with each diagnosis. However, if our health diagnosing application also records the user’s data, the diagnoses should require no medical background questions in addition to providing a more accurate diagnosis by utilising health records in addition to symptoms.
By utilising the health records of the user, the application would become more comprehensive than other previous health diagnoses applications, but there are also other valuable features that can be added to by utilising current technologies. Another important secondary feature includes using technology such as smart/fitness watches to track and record data such as blood pressure, oxygen levels, and resting heart rate. This tracked data would be automatically used by the application to provide a more accurate diagnosis. At the beginning stages of the project, it was the goal to increase the number of compatible devices that would record health data so that the application could improve its pool of medical information to diagnose with.</p>

  <p>After considering the improvements to make upon the health diagnoses application, there were many areas that were still vague and needed refinement. Consideration was needed for which types of devices would be integrated, and whether the application would be on mobiles or just a browser site. Further discussion by the group of which features we wanted to include would build upon the initial idea and was expected to be an ongoing process. </p>


 <p><B> How the project idea progressed </B></p>
  <p>Continuing from the initial ideas from assignment 1 and 2 we kept the fundamental idea of providing a health diagnosing application that utilises recorded medical health data and symptom checking questions to provide accurate and efficient health diagnoses. </p>
  <p>Building upon this core idea we considered the feedback from assignment 1 of using artificial intelligence to enhance the health diagnosing ability of the application, and assignment 2 to elaborate and highlight the core features. Considering this feedback and brainstorming within the group resulted in us agreeing on the following features:</p>
<p>*A health diagnose would be given based on a series of health-related questions </p>
<p>*Record a health profile of the user to provide a comprehensive dataset for the application to use in the diagnosing process and remove the need to enter medical history with future uses. </p>
<p>*Utilise devices such as smart watches to track and record health data (blood pressure, blood oxygen levels, and resting heart rate) which would be utilised by the application to provide more accurate diagnoses.</p>
<p>*Provide an online forum for users to talk about health interests or concerns </p>
<p>*Use artificial intelligence to sort through the vast amounts of medical information .</p>
<p>*The application would use cloud technology to ensure no data is lost and it is always accessible from any location. </p>
<p>*Compatibility with ‘My health record’ to connect the health diagnosing application with the information provided by the user’s medical professionals. The application would utilise this information to provide more accurate diagnoses.</p>


<p> After finalising our planned features, we set goals and completed the overview section of the project. However, a large part of the project requires expertise that far surpasses what our group is capable of.  Upon realising this technical limitation, we decided to progress the project by researching the services, technologies, and medical data sources that could be used to create our health diagnoses application. After this, we made an example user interface that will serve as a visual guide for progressing the project idea.</p>

  <p><B> Cloud computing </B></p>
  <p>Accessing our application remotely is a large part of the applications utility. If the application can store data remotely and securely, as it offered by many cloud service providers, then the user’s will be able to conveniently use the application from any location. This also offers the user the benefit of data-loss prevention. </p>
    <p>Cloud servers are also important for storing the vast amounts of medical information for the application to use in its diagnosing processes. With everything being stored and analysed by the cloud, it reduces computing and storage demands required from the end-user devices (mobile phones, fitness watches and personal computers). The computing allows the application to store data remotely without worries of losing data on local devices.  </p>
      <p>With user convenience and the immense data storage needs required of the application our group has chosen to go with a leading cloud services retailer: Amazon Web Services (AWS). We have chosen AWS for the sheer availability of additional services and features compared to other mainstream retailers (like google and Microsoft). We have decided to use their “Software as a Service” which will allow us to not worry about any of the operating system, data, infrastructure, or other requirements during the development process. This is also taking into considering other services we will utilise from them AWS such as artificial intelligence.</p>

  <p><B> Artificial Intelligence </B></p>

  <p>Using artificial intelligence, the application will sort through vast amounts of medical information, analyse it, and offer advice that is specific to the individual’s situation. Artificial intelligence has the benefit of being able to learn from this data and improve upon future advice. With the increasing data collection from users, the advice will improve over time. Previous health diagnosis applications utilising artificial intelligence would offer advice based on described symptoms – such as fever, insomnia, or pain -- which would potentially provide diagnoses not specific to the user. The proposed application will provide a more specific diagnosis by using the user’s medical history and current monitored health data in addition to the described symptoms.</p>
    <p>Our team has decided to use artificial intelligence services available by AWS. This is partly due to us using them for their cloud services but also due to their extensive range of different artificial intelligence services. An example of this is their artificial intelligence related to the health field: Healthlake. Healthlake as an Artificial intelligence that can take unstructured data, analyse it and transform it into a more comprehensible form. It is an example of one of AWS’s technologies available that can be used in conjunction with other forms as shown in figure 1. </p>

  <p>Figure 1: Amazon HealthLake (Preview) – Making Sense of Health Data – Amazon Web Services Technologies </p>



 <p><B>Technologies </B></p>

<p>There are a wide range of fitness watches that our application can utilise to provide up-to-date and comprehensive health data. For example, an apple watch can track blood pressure, blood-oxygen levels, and heart rate. This is a small set of data that can be added to the broad range of medical data being used during our applications health diagnoses. </p>
<p>We acknowledge there are a range of devices that can be added to the application in the future, but we first intend to focus on the implementation of the smart watch. An example of an additional device could be Smart pills. Smart pills are a drug that contains sensers in it that activate when the ingested pill meets stomach fluids. This Smart pill is commonly used to record compliance for medication.  </p>

  <p><B>Sources of medical information </B></p>

  <p>In addition to the health data collected by fitness watches and other devices, the application will source medical information from peer-reviewed medical science journals, medical dictionaries of thousands of diseases, and data from other users.  </p>
  <p>In addition to these sources of information, it is also our applications goal to become compatible and share consent of other information sources like ‘My Health Records’ is a government endorsed hub for storing and editing patient data by their medical professionals. Usually these records are only viewable, but not editable, by approved third-party applications, but it is our goal to improve the intractability between our application and My Health Records. </p>
