 <h3>Jacob’s perspective </h3>
<B>What went well </B>
<p>I was very thankful for discovering and using MS teams during the group process, I had not used the application until I started working with the group and I found it all went okay because of teams. Sharing files between the group through teams kept the group updated so once we all knew what each member had to do, everybody was able to put in the work and make progress.  </p>
<B>What could be improved? </B>
<p>The rate at what we did stay in contact to keep progressing could have been better with a little more communication. Once we got the process of things eventually it got easier, but I think our overall process could improve. Everybody chose a role in how they would contribute to the assignments, there just was not much clarification on where everyone was at progress wise. </p>
<B>At least one thing that was surprising </B>
<p>Working in groups is a different thing for me, I would not say I prefer group work, but I was surprised how easy the other members I was working with did make it at times. A little confusion following the rubric myself but listening to others in the group piece it together helped me understand it more. And not to mention teams, once I found out what it is, I was so surprised, the capabilities. </p>
<B>At least one thing that you have learned about groups </B>
<p>I have figured I did not really enjoy online group work, but I enjoyed learning what I learnt throughout the process. Whether it was from others in the group or through my own research during working with the group, I learnt that once all the work is compiled together from everyone overtime, it can be a lot. I would still say I prefer working individually or less - ‘remote’ at least.</p>
