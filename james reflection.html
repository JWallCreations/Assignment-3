 <h3>James’s perspective </h3>

 <B>What went well </B>
 <p>Collaborating with the other group members was easy using Teams. We stayed in contact through messages which was convenient for all given our limited availability for team meetings. During our time messaging each other we were able to effectively allocate tasks and give suggestions on each other's contribution. </p>

 <B>What could be improved </B>
 <p>Although tasks were allocated and we contributed advice to each other’s delegated task, some tasks still required prerequisite tasks to be completed before they could be completed. An improvement would be to review which tasks were required to be completed before other tasks could be completed.  </p>

 <B>At least one thing that was surprising </B>
 <p>The most surprising thing about the assignment was how difficult making progress on our idea was. Our group lacked the technical expertise required to make progress on an interactive application. In addition to an interactive application, even deciding which technology should be used was surprisingly difficult due to our lack of knowledge on which artificial intelligence, and cloud services, products would be most suitable for the applications needs. </p>

 <B>At least one thing that you have learned about groups </B>
 <p>It is especially important to project to plan contributions early on, even if they are small, so we can get a grasp on how difficult producing artefacts for the assignment could be. This importance would apply to working with any groups in the future: delegate tasks early and according to ability whilst considering what can feasibly be accomplished.</p>
