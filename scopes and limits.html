<h2>Scopes and limits  </h2>
 <p>The scope is rather huge with this application with its consistent monitoring and diagnosis of user's medical issues. This application will ever be expanding with content due to various medical diseases and issues, evermore so in today's climate with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic this application would greatly reduce the need for “corona scans'' where users will be able to do it at home reducing the risk of transmission and so on. This application will have an ever-expanding scope due to the never-ending medical material in today's world. The application will first identify the symptoms and diagnose the user with the resulting diagnosis and then go on to display an array of treatments that the user can purchase or perform and in server cases see a medical practitioner. Taking into consideration the time restraints to fully develop this app we shall be limiting ourselves to one medical problem where the user inputs their symptoms and the AI determines the medical diagnosis for example “the common cold” as this is a common disease which affects millions around the world. The application has an infinite amount of scope as this application would ever be expanding with more information, more diagnosis, and more features such as “doctor chats” and much more.  </p>
<p>This is an ambitious project idea and due to the time restraints, we unfortunately cannot produce the full application with all the features we would like to provide. We understand this limitation and understand that this would be an example of the ‘scope creep’ which is where an application continuously keeps developing overtime with new features and information. This most of all would have to be a severe limitation as we cannot incorporate all that we want to with this application. The application we are going to showcase will be a demonstration of what our health application can potentially achieve. </p>

<h2> Tools and technologies  </h2>
 <p>To create this ambitious application, we will need the use of various code languages such as ES7 JavaScript, Python 3.9.0, W3.CSS and HTML5 which will significantly aid in developing the bare basics of this application. Predominantly ES7 JavaScript, HTML5 and W3.CSS will be used with occasional Python 3.9.o support. With these tools we will be able to create the base of our website ensuring its functionality. To create a pleasant aesthetic appearance for all users and users (our target market) we will be using Adobe Illustrator, XD, Photoshop and Lightroom. These apps will add an aesthetic feel to our application which will be appreciated for all users no matter their age demographic.</p>
 <p>To truly develop a demonstration application with the time restraints for this project. We have decided to use an app developing website which will aid us in developing an application we would feel proud to showcase. We used “fluidui.com” to develop a demonstration interface that will be simple and easy for users to interact with, creating a secure and assuring aesthetic for our users.</p>

 <h2>Testing</h2>
 <p>We will test our application via the “fluidui.com” application where we will develop a quick demonstration where we can interact with the application illustrating its several interfaces and more. Our demo application will consist of ONE diagnosis which I'll be the “common cold” to highlight the potential of this application and what it can become. This User interface was developed with the following in mind “simplicity, easy to operate, built for all ages and a secure feel”. With that in mind we researched various interface arrangements and found that simplicity was the key to captivate all age demographics to use our application. Various alterations were made to the interface to fit the “Simplicity” profile we were hoping to develop. And the results are… </p>
