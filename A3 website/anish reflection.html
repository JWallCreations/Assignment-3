<h3>Anish’s perspective </h3>
<B>What went well </B>
<p>Our communication towards the start of this project was extremely limited as we didn't get into contact before the Easter weekend, this lack of initiative is reflected throughout our work. But towards the end of this project our communication began to steadily get better as were communicating on a day-to-day basis about the project. Our assistance to one another. The group has been fantastic to work with as they have been supportive and understanding of everyone's issues as we are all unfamiliar with the operations of GitHub and html/CSS. They have provided excellent assistance when needed and have been excellent team members. </p>

<B>What could be improved </B>
<p>During the start of this project our communication was very little, and we got into the project fully after the easter weekend. This lack of communication resulted in a loss of time and if we didn't have an extension, I personally feel we would not have completed this project. To correct this fault, we should in our next group assessment get into contact as soon as possible and start communicating about it to avoid time loss. As a group we could improve on our time management as we underestimated the time and resulted in a panic during the end of this project. To avoid this, we should in the next assignment get into contact as soon as possible so we have time to organise and plan how to effectively get this project done. </p>

<B>At least one thing that was surprising </B>
<p>Online group tasks are new to me as I've never been in an online group typically, I would meet up with the people that I was placed in a group in and get things working from there but this was a strange yet good experience. It was challenging as you cannot physically be there in person and discuss meetings and it's complicated working in an online group as there are so many uncontrolled variables. </p>

<B>At least one thing that you have learned about groups </B>
<p>That it’s a wonderful experience but maybe not for me I've always preferred to work alone where i can control my variables. The team was excellent and provided amazing support and communication. Just this “online teams” isn't for me. </p>
