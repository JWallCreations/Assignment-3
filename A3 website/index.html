<p><B>PERSONAL INFORMATION</B></p>
      <p>Our group at “FortyOne” comprises of 4 members extremely interested in everything tech, working together as a team to accomplish any problem, task or project put in front of us to the best of our combined abilities.</p>



    <h3>GET TO KNOW US</h3>

    <p><B>Aaron George S39008226</B><p>
    <p><B>A Paragraph from Aaron;</B><p>
    <p>Aaron is from Melbourne, Australia, with a successfully completion of VCE. Enjoys most sports and have competed in many team sports like Soccer and Australian rules football, currently competes in both off the beach and keelboat sailing. He is easy going, enjoys meeting new people and experiencing new things. In the future hopes to travel and work overseas, experiencing life in another culture. Has always had curiously of how things worked. Experimented with broken items by dismantling them and rebuilding. He has successfully repaired electronical items. He has also put components together to make computers. Has enjoyed using basic programming tasks, like to make electronic toys move for example. His idea job would be working within the construction industry. He would love to have a role in an elite racing sport field such as F1 motor racing or sailing.</p>

<p><B>James Wall S39008226</B><p>

<p><B>A Paragraph from James;</B><p>
    <p>James is interest in Information Technology comes from the constant reminders of daily life that Information Technology is a benefit. I previously served in the army reserves as a rifleman for 2 years. I served almost 10 years ago, so I was quite young. During this period, I was not deployed so most of the time was spent training. I found it to be one of the most formative periods of my earlier life. Technology is increasingly becoming a part of the financial industry and innovation is highly desired. The application of programming and the desire for innovation in this industry makes striving to participate in it very exciting. In addition to the completion of a degree, I will need to prove my value by completing programming projects with the relevant technical skills that showcase my ability to first start in a junior or graduate java developer position.</p>

    <p><B>Anish Pisavadia S3893815</B><p>

    <p><B>A Paragraph from Anish;</B><p>
    <p>Before pursuing a career in IT Anish accomplished 1stand 2nd-degree education. My nationality is British/Australian but culturally Indian, I speak Gujarati which is my national Indian language. I had first sparked an interest in IT attending coding classes in high school, where I learnt basic Python, which sparked an interest in Programming which led me to discover many IT based careers. Towards the end of my high school days, I discovered a “Information Technology” degree and decided that was my steppingstone to becoming a cybersecurity analyst. There were certain experiences that swayed me into the IT profession, like during the first major lockdown in 2020, where in Sydney we had 3 months of online schooling which resulted in me having extra time on my hands to discover and indulge in basic HTML and Python tutorials online. The more I learned with both languages, the more I became fascinated with Programming.</p>

  <p><B>Jacob Britton S3908842</B><p>

  <p><B>A Paragraph from Jacob</B><p>
    <p>Jacob grew up in a variety of rural country towns in Victoria, Australia after moving around a lot. I finished year 12 at Maffra Secondary College, whilst undergoing and completing a Cert II in Electrotechnology for the final 2 years of high school. Things I would do in my free time consisted of a LOT of video games but also Music once I found that to be a big passion of mine. My interest in technology started as soon as I was introduced to a gaming console and first mobile phone, my interest grew greatly once I was gifted a low-grade custom-built PC. Wanting to know more and how to upgrade PC’s, I took a dive into the “unknowing” world of PC parts and upgrading them, which opened a whole new passion. Being very interested in computer and tech hardware firstly, the hands-on troubleshooting and repairing tech appliances or software appeals to me most for my ideal role, as resolving issues or malfunctions with devices and applications provides me with a great sense of accomplishment</p>




<h3>GROUP PROCESS.</h3>
<p>During assignment 2 our process was lacking in the very beginning at first, but once we were able to solve the problem and organise ourselves, we were able to operate productively and keep the ball rolling at all times. We struggled to get face-toface for some if not most of our meetings to discuss progress and contributions, we improvised with the MS teams group chat by messaging one another and sometimes by email. Not having all group members did prove to make the rest of the assignment more difficult with communication lacking on some of our behalf’s, not knowing the general plan each week for everyone left a sense of unknowing in some areas/sections of the assignment. Going forward with A3 as a group we wanted to be more connected and work more as a team with changes in not so much how we communicate, but how often. Evidently in A2 the team would often lose track of where each member was at with their work, so introducing two main days where we would schedule our meets on seemed beneficial. Mondays and Wednesdays became our days for discussing and reviewing our work and how we were going to go about said work. During assignment 2 we distributed tasks per the rubric marking to each of us evenly and that was our way of progressing forwards, but in assignment 3 most of the work relies on our Project Idea being our focus and requires all our attention on the one task. Hence why our process of communication and staying connected needed changes, to complete the task at hand at the best rate we can as a group.</p>

<h3>CAREER PLANS.</h3>
<p></p>

<p><B>Cyber Security Risk Analysist, Java Developer, Media & Events Associate and Computing Systems Engineer.</B><p>
<p>As per group reflection over assignment 2 and the beginning of assignment 3, everyone’s ideal job and career preferences have stayed the same mostly. Now having a little extra experience in a secluded online team environment, it allows us individually to analyse what went well, and want did not go so well for ourselves. With the experience of the process so far in mind, we can improve on the skills or abilities we may or may not possess and avoid the problems that may be faced when working with others to complete tasks inside of a time frame. Each of our career plans seem similar, we are all studying and researching to learn the appropriate knowledge required to each of our desired roles inside the IT industry as a broader sense. In saying that there’s differences in our chosen paths, from Systems Engineer to Media & Events, Java Developer to Cyber Security, there are different aspects of IT we are all interested in and hope to have a career revolving around.</p>
<p><B>Our Ideal Job Demand:</B></p>
<p>Upon looking over the burning glass data I was able to find Java Developer’s being the highest in-demand job out of the 4 ideal jobs listed above. Computer systems engineers or architects are also in high demand according to data, but I would not say as much as Software or Java developers. Cyber security and Media & Events jobs were difficult to put above or below one other, but in saying that with privacy mattering more and more as we advance with technology, it makes sense for Security Analysts to rank a little higher in terms of employer-demand, as recorded in burning glass data. Media & Events jobs demand proves to be increasing, again with technology advancing there is not many jobs that are not IT-related or at least becoming reliant on IT, but I feel confident in saying, although preferences are bound to change slightly, our 4 chosen ideal jobs are some of the most in-demand in the employment market. [Source: Labour Insight Jobs (Burning Glass Technologies) (dec,24,2017-march,2018)]</p>

<p><B>Skill Demand:</B></p>
<p>There are also certain skills or ability sets that employers tend to look for in an employee upon consideration of employment as found earlier through research in our ideal jobs. Each of must possess certain and different industry skills individually to appeal to potential businesses, clients, and employers. Whilst building on the more specific skills through studies or experience is all a part of career growth and can improve over time inside the industry doing the work, there are also a lot of general skills each of us possess and can work on to better our likes of employment and up our performance inside the job.</p>

<p><B>Group’s General Skill Set:</B></p>
<p>• Teamwork & Communication, Networking, Relationship building.</p>
<p>• Problem solving, Troubleshooting, Critical thinking</p>
<p>• Organisation, Time management, efficiency.</p>
<p>• Presentation Skills, Multi-tasking, writing.</p>
<p>• Creativity, Analytical Skills, Research</p>

  <p><B>Overview</B><p>

<p>The project will be a health diagnoses application that will give health diagnoses and advice based on the user’s health data and described symptoms.  It will use an android application to provide a broad range of features that are usually separated into different applications. These services will involve health advice, health tracking, and discussion forums, which will provide benefits to the user and consulted medical professionals. Health advice will offer preventative and reactive medical advice which enables the user to improve health whilst preventing and treating illnesses.</p>
<p>To provide the high-quality advice, artificial intelligence and cloud computing services will be used to store and analyse medical data which advises based on the latest medical standards. Additionally, forums will be used to discuss health, fitness, and general topics which will provide a social and engaging atmosphere. The application is intended as a tool to be used in conjunction with the appropriate healthcare professionals should be consulted about the information provided by the application. </p>

    <p><B>Roles</B></p>
<p>Our group did not formally designate roles within the project. The team members attempted to help each other in their tasks which resulted in a blend of contribution in all aspect of the assignment. However, even though we shared in other’s tasks, we could potentially define the following roles in the group based on their main contributions. </p>
<p><B>Anish: User-interface and web developer </B></p>
<p>*Anish was responsible for the presentation task and the artefact of the application. This primarily involved the design and implementation of how the website and health application would look or interact. </p>
<p><B>James: Project designer </B></p>
<p>*James mainly worked on the project design and the features that would be implemented based on his own research and the team’s input. </p>
<p><B>Aaron: Project management and Human resources</B></p>
<p>*Aaron’s focus was on the timeframe and skills and jobs. This required investigating which employees we would need to further progress the application and planning the project’s timeframe to achieve desired outcomes. </p>
<p><B>Jacob: Marketing  </B></p>
<p>Jacob’s focus was on using all the information provided in assignment 3 to develop a marketing idea and plan for the presentation in Assignment 5.</p>

    <p><B>Scopes and limits:</B></p>

 <p>The scope is rather huge with this application with its consistent monitoring and diagnosis of user's medical issues. This application will ever be expanding with content due to various medical diseases and issues, evermore so in today's climate with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic this application would greatly reduce the need for “corona scans'' where users will be able to do it at home reducing the risk of transmission and so on. This application will have an ever-expanding scope due to the never-ending medical material in today's world. The application will first identify the symptoms and diagnose the user with the resulting diagnosis and then go on to display an array of treatments that the user can purchase or perform and in server cases see a medical practitioner. Taking into consideration the time restraints to fully develop this app we shall be limiting ourselves to one medical problem where the user inputs their symptoms and the AI determines the medical diagnosis for example “the common cold” as this is a common disease which affects millions around the world. The application has an infinite amount of scope as this application would ever be expanding with more information, more diagnosis, and more features such as “doctor chats” and much more.</p>

  <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Risks</b></h1>
  <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">

<p>With a project of this scale, there is no doubting the risks that may be involved. From how the products received by the audience to expectations of certain applications/software not functioning in the way its expected or hoped to. Not having too much experience in developing apps, the project faces risks in terms of development of the needed software to hold and collect all the health information of all its users in the one cloud. </p>
<p>Health systems already exist to store all client’s health records and information; therefore, it becomes more about integration of our developed app with said existing systems. We could potentially face security or privacy risks with this in mind as our apps system would rely on access to an abundance of medical data and records, possibly transferred through cloud computing. Due to the app using, storing, and maintaining highly confidential information the biggest risk is data leakage. </p>
<p>Manufacturing our app specific hardware is quite important for the app to perform at full force in union with our hardware, for example, custom design smartwatches, fall-support-belt, and the concept smart pill. Whilst the concept of custom designed technology to support our application sounds beneficial, there is great risk in developing them as quickly as the consumer may need or want. Due to a lack of knowledge or experience in hardware development, without hiring external forces that have the knowledge, we could encounter a lot of faulty technology design which could prove detrimental. With that in mind, it's no secret there is a massive amount of funding that is required for such technology, as well as the costing for the rest of the project, such as paying developers or funding the software development. Taking on hardware manufacturing early is a great risk to the group financially and timewise on its own alongside everything else that needs developing to produce an app and system that works to a user standard.</p>



<div class="w3-container" id="Group processes and communication" style="margin-top:75px">
  <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Group processes and communication</b></h1>
  <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">

<p>Communication throughout the group is pivotal in mission success and plays a huge part in reaching the project goals we set for ourselves along the way. Our team stays quite connected through MS Teams as well as emailing so holding communication in high regards throughout the process is a no-brainer. Already being aware of the consequences that occur from lack of staying in touch, face-to-face meetings are detrimental throughout our weeks to keep eir sole tasks.
A Minimum of 1 face-to-face meeting over MS-team’s is required per week to keep the team on track and on the same page noting any progression or mishaps they may have with certain areas inside the project. If a member of the group is not reachable at the time they are needed, tagging them in all messages or updates and emailing said person is a good idea to keep them updated once they do become available or return, whatever the case may be. This then provides the opportunity for a falling behind team-mate who may be lacking on communication to catch-up and speed themselves up to scratch once they have seen what they have missed. Discussing amongst the group and determining times and days suited to everyone to catch up face-to-face for meetings during each of our weeks will keep everyone connected enough to form a plan and method of commitment individually, and with everyone’s efforts combined it will help bring our project to life.
With organised, set up meetings booked in through MS teams, each member of the team will know when they need to be available to meet by viewing their MS Teams calendar and acknowledging what days and time’s meetings are each week. All of which can be rescheduled or revaluated and should have gained approval from all members of the group before setting up new scheduled meetings.</p>

  <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Group Reflection: Team</b></h1>
  <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">

<p><B>Group’s perspective </B></p>
<p>We were a group of four, all with busy lives and commitments outside of this unit Introduction to Information Technology.  When working on a project as part of a team in a workplace, meeting can be scheduled a lot easier amongst colleagues.  When studying on campus again it is easy to meet up after or before class.  Online learning is a completely different settling, with a far narrower window of opportunities.  Not everyone attends online lectures at the same time as online offers flexibility. </p>

<p><B>What went well</B></p>
<p>The group’s communication and allocating of tasks was a smooth process. We summarised and put all the required tasks in a document for people to pick and record which parts of the assignment they would like to complete. Using teams was especially useful for recording this as multiple people could alter the same form detailing contributions. This was functionally important due to us mainly using messaging as a means of communication. If people did not record which tasks they were doing then it could result in group members completing the same tasks.</p>

<p>In addition to choosing individual contributions, the team also chose an appropriate workload of contribution from the tasks available in the document. This allowed for people to choose their tasks according to their preferences and skill sets. For example, Anish had previously worked on website for assignment 2, it was efficient for them to also complete the website for assignment 3.</p>
<p><B>Detailing the sections as described in the assignment the tasks were distributed below:</B></p>
<p>James: Overview (topic, motivation, landscape) + Detailed description (aims, plans and progress, roles) + Group’s (group) perspective</p>
<p>Aaron: Skills & jobs + Detailed description (timeframe) </p>
<p>Anish: Tools + presentation + Detailed description (limits, tools and tech, testing, project idea artefact) + Assignment 5 script </p>
<p>Jacob: Team profile + detailed description (Group processes and communication, Risks) + Assignment 5 script and presentation </p>
<p>Everyone put in and worked hard to get the job done.  As the tasks were not worth equal marks, some members ended up doing more than others. This is how group project works even in the workforce.  This is not how it should work but is how most teamwork projects end up working if they require constant input by all members. </p>
<p><B>What could be improved </B></p>
<p>In the early weeks of assignment 3, we all contributed ideas and suggestions for the assignment improvements and changes to the project idea described in our assignment 2. During this time is would have been wise to also discuss the limitations on creating artefacts for assignment 3. Many of our members lacked the skills required to develop interactive applications which could have resulted in us changing our project idea or brainstorming more about which artefacts would be feasible. </p>
<p><B>At least one thing that was surprising </B></p>
<p>One thing our group found surprising was how much we could accomplish despite our different availability for Teams meetings. Although we set  early concrete meeting times, hiccups occurred in member schedules, which lead to cancellations. We were initially worried about our ability to collaborate due to different availability of times for Teams meetings, but eventually realised the effectiveness of how much we could accomplish in a short period of time by effectively distributing tasks. Although assignment 3 was quite large and we also had to prepare the assignment 5 presentation, we all managed to contribute to the assignment. </p>
<p><B>At least one thing that you have learned about groups </B></p>
<p>When you only have four weeks to complete an assignment a week is a long time and things to not always go to plan. Our group learned the importance of making progress earlier. We realised that along the way we have lost group members and that if additional group members left during assignment 3 then the already large task, for our group of 4, would become less manageable. We were fortunate that our team continued to make contributions throughout the study period and stayed until the end. </p>
