<h3>Aaron’s perspective </h3>

<B>What went well </B>
<p>I can say I find working in teams remotely not easy, but our group members seem to be very understanding and worked around our difference and errors to get the job done.  This means it was a successful team project. </p>

<B>What could be improved  </B>
<p>Better time management and communication skills. The problem with different member schedules and working online, not everyone is working at the same time. A member can be held up team when working and if they get stuck, they may need to wait from input from others.   </p>
<B>At least one thing that was surprising about the people in your group </B>
<p>One thing that surprised me about each member of the group was how flexible they were. James did not care that he seemed to be constantly adding to his list of tasks.  Jacob did not shy away from preparing the video production.  Anish was great at the programing side and really seem to enjoy it. </p>
<B>At least one thing that you have learned about groups </B>
<p>You learn a lot about people and really need to work together and compromise, ideas. Each member of the team is required to be individually working towards the completion of a project. </p>
